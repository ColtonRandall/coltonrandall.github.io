            Hi! 👋
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm Colton, the proud dual citizen of two of the most beautiful
            countries in the world, Canada - my birthplace, and New Zealand -
            where I grew up.

            Fast forward to 2013. I had just finished high-school and felt the
            need to explore the world. I wanted to do something unique, only for
            the opportunity to volunteer in Rwanda presented itself.

            In Rwanda, I taught English at a local orphanage and a nearby
            preschool, needless to say, it was an enriching, but eye-opening
            experience. It changed me in more ways than I ever imagined. I of
            course, then had the urge to go back to Africa three years later for
            more volunteer work, this time to Kenya, I taught Maths and Physics
            at a high school in Kibera - the largest slum in Africa. I also
            worked as a healthcare assistant deeper in the slum to help local
            doctors treat the residents for Malaria and various respiratory
            infections.

            After my experiences in Africa, I developed an interest in
            Healthcare and emerging Biotechnology, which led me to major in
            Biochemistry in Dunedin, New Zealand.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my degree, Genetic Engineering and Bioinformatics played a
            big part in the course content, along with the treatment of cancer.
            We breifly played around with R and Python scripting, which was my
            first introduction to programming, which I took an interest in. The
            only complicating factor? At the end of my degree, I had an
            opportunity to do an intro flight at a local flight club, where I
            found a passion for Aviation...

            As a kid, flying was always one of those deep-seeded passions that I
            never really expected I'd pursue, but the combination of the intro
            flight in 2018, and a shortage of pilots, triggered an interest in
            giving it a go. I enrolled in a full-time course in 2019 to chase
            the path of being a pilot.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once I got my private license (PPL), Covid-19 hit the world. This
            global event and it's inevitable impact on the Aviation industry
            forced me to step back and reconsider this path.

          <p id="xeroContent">
            During lockdown, I wanted to be as productive as possible, and fell
            back on honing in on my interest in Programming that sparked while
            doing Bioinformatics. I tried to learn as much web development
            technologies as possible, which continued to become more and more
            interesting the better I got. Once lockdown ended, I managed to
            secure myself three part-time jobs as a Bioinformatics Research
            Assistant. These jobs allowed me to dive into more practical
            programming, while continuing to progress through the online
            courses, and slowly updated my GitHub profile with small projects.

            <br />
            <br />

            I decided some formal programming training would benefit me moving
            forward, so I enrolled in the Postgraduate Certificate in
            Information Technology (PGCertIT) at Auckland University, which was
            a condensed period of both theory, and hands-on experience in Web
            Development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL) and
            Object Oriented Programming in Java. In this course, I achieved two
            'Certificate of Outstanding Achievement' awards, and qualified for
            the Masters of Information Technology (MInfoTech), where I
            specialised in Software Development and Health Informatics.

            <br />
            <br />

            Through this, I managed to get multiple offers from companies for a
            summer internship and I ended up accepting one at Xero. I worked
            hard enough to ask to stay on as a Graduate Engineer, which was
            approved!

            <br />

            From the Graduate program at Xero I eventually got promoted to
            Associate Engineer, and a year later got promoted to an Intermediate
            Full-Stack Engineer and have continued to enjoy learning how to
            become the best Engineer I can be, in both technical and
            non-technical skills.
